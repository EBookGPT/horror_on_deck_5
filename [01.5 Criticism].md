## Horror on Deck 5: A Critique 

This story has potential, but it's drowning in **telling** instead of **showing**. The author relies heavily on exposition,  describing feelings and atmosphere rather than letting the reader experience them through actions and sensory details. This makes the story feel flat and lifeless, lacking the visceral impact of true horror.

**Here's a breakdown of the issues and how to improve them:**

**1.  "Show, Don't Tell" - The Fatal Flaw**

* **Example:** "The air hung heavy, thick with a tension that made Emily's breath catch in her throat." 
    * **Instead:**  Describe the air - is it clammy?  Does it smell like something is rotting?  Does the temperature shift? Does Emily's chest tighten, her heart beat faster?  Show the physical manifestations of her anxiety, and let the reader infer the tension. 

* **Example:** "Alistair, however, seemed unfazed by the oppressive atmosphere, his presence a beacon of calm amidst the swirling storm of Emily's fears."
    * **Instead:** Describe Alistair's actions. Does he whistle a tune? Does he walk with a purposeful stride, ignoring the creaking floorboards?  Focus on his calm demeanor amidst the unsettling environment. 

**2.  Dull Dialogue:**

* The dialogue is mostly expositional, lacking the spark of real conversation.  Characters state their thoughts and feelings rather than expressing them through their words.

* **Example:** "The ship is alive," he whispered, his voice tinged with an almost hypnotic fascination, "and it is hungry."
    * **Instead:**  Give Alistair a more nuanced line. Does he mention a specific sound he hears, a strange scent, a feeling of energy around them? Does he make a cryptic statement that hints at a deeper understanding of the ship? 

**3.  The Narrative Voice Needs Direction:**

* The narrative voice is often overly descriptive and intrusive, telling us what to think and feel. 
    * **Instead:**  Focus on Emily's internal struggles, her thoughts, and reactions to the environment.  Let her actions and observations guide the reader's understanding of the story.

**4.  Lack of Suspense:**

* The pacing is uneven, with too much exposition and not enough action.  The story relies on foreshadowing and hints of danger rather than building suspense through concrete threats.

* **Example:** "Alistair, his eyes gleaming with a sinister light, seemed to relish in the unsettling atmosphere." 
    * **Instead:**  Show Alistair doing something unsettling -  he touches a cold, clammy wall, a smile creeps across his face, he stares at Emily with an unsettling intensity. 

**5.  The Entity is a Plot Device, Not a Character:**

* The entity is described as a force, a power, but it lacks a personality or a specific presence. 
    * **Instead:**  Give the entity a distinct "voice" - is it a whispering presence, a guttural growl, a shifting shadow?  Show how it interacts with the environment, the characters, and Emily's mind.

**Constructive Suggestions:**

* **Focus on Atmosphere:**  Use vivid imagery, sensory details, and subtle cues to create a truly chilling atmosphere. 
* **Develop Character Interactions:**  Use dialogue to reveal characters' motivations, fears, and secrets.  Let the characters' interactions drive the plot.
* **Create Concrete Threats:**  Instead of hinting at danger, show the characters facing real threats. Give the entity a clear presence and specific actions.
* **Embrace the Unseen:**  Don't explain everything.  Leave room for mystery and ambiguity, allowing the reader to fill in the blanks and experience the fear of the unknown.

**Remember, Horror is about suspense, tension, and the exploration of the darkest corners of the human psyche.  Show, don't tell, and let the reader experience the terror firsthand.**
